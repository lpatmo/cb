<h3>What is CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p>We're a community of independent code learners who sometimes schedule Google Hangouts to co-work silently on personal projects, pair program, or help each other master tutorials. Sharing knowledge with others is fun and helps us learn faster. The project is free and <a href="https://github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform" target="_blank">open-sourced on Github.</a> A <a href="https://github.com/lpatmo/cb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed" target="_blank">couple of awesome people</a> have made pull requests to this platform so far! :) </p>
<p>We now also have a public <a href="//codebuddiesmeet.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Slack chatroom</a>, a third-party chatroom app with multiple channels where you can jump in to say hello, ask for advice, share what you're working on, follow up after a Google Hangout, or find new study partners. <a href="//codebuddiesmeet.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">You can invite yourself to the chatroom here.</a></p>

<h3>Do I need to pay anything?</h3>
<p>No. It's a free and safe space. The study sessions are peer-to-peer organized and we help each other out.</p>

<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What's the inspiration behind CodeBuddies?</h3>
<p> The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn to code on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, <em>people</em> -- mentors, co-workers, hackathon buddies, and study partners -- are key to accelerating one's learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Who can join?</h3>
<p>Anyone can sign up as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to <em>be</em> or aspire to be a career programmer. Code literacy is for everyone.</p>

<h3>How do I join one of the study sessions?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click "I want to join."</li>
<li>Click the green "launch hangout" button when the study session is in progress. (If the hangout is in progress, you'll see the event at the top of the home page.)</li>
<li>When you join the google hangout, <strong>mute your video camera</strong> <img src="http://codebuddies.org/images/icon-video-off.png" alt="turn off video" width="25" height="25"/> to save on bandwidth. </li>
<li>If everyone shares their screens, we can share our work and help each other out more easily. You can <strong>screen share</strong> by <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-screenshare.png"/> clicking on the green icon on the left (and the first window that appears after that). Google Hangouts lets multiple people screen share at the same time.  </li>
<li><strong>At a study session tagged <a href="http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/category/silent-hangout" class="post-category example category-silent-hangout">silent hangout</a>,</strong> everyone turns off BOTH video and audio and works at their own pace on the topic proposed. Screenshare to share your progress, and use the chatroom to ask questions and help each other out. </li>
<li>At a non-silent hangout, feel free to use the microphone, or if everyone is on the same page of a tutorial, try <strong>taking turns talking through the code out loud.</strong> Give everyone a chance to speak and ask questions. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Testimonials from the community:</h3>
<blockquote>CodeBuddies is an awesome place for learning individuals to meet up and tackle a project/book as a group. Talking through problems and concepts with other people has helped me understand some of the harder topics in programming! - Charlie L.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Virtual hangouts with CodeBuddies made learning to code much easier and a fun process for me. As a consultant, I am always on the road, so I cannot always go to in-person coding sessions or meetups. Learning to code was an extremely frustrating process and I had given up on programming multiple times previously. Now, thanks to CodeBuddies, I can attend programming session while I am away from home. Codebuddies took away all the frustrations and made it very easy for me to learn programming. - Muhammed Z.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I've been participating in CodeBuddies for about five months now and I've seen my skills and motivation to continue learning improve dramatically. The Google Group conversations help keep my Javascript practice front of mind; it's hard to let more than a few days pass without learning of a new resource that I want to try out. Going into 2015, I’m really excited to be a part of the CodeBuddies community. - Elaine M.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Codebuddies.org is a great way to meet like-minded people studying web development. There's a ton of tech out there to learn, and one of the great things Codebuddies.org does is bring together people with varying levels of experience on everything from HTML to Javascript frameworks. It's a great way to collaborate, meet new people, and ask for help. - Scott L.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Codebuddies gave me the impetus to work through Marijn Haverbeke's invaluable book, Eloquent JavaScript (I'm still working on it). It also introduced me to a bunch of developers far more experienced than I am, people who have pushed me and encouraged me at times when my confidence flagged. The people who make up CodeBuddies are great! - Ethan R.</blockquote>

<h3>What's the history behind CodeBuddies?</h3>
<p>Linda (<a href="http://bit.ly/1u7C0KQ">@lpnotes</a>) wanted to become a better web developer (and help others discover the joy of making things come alive on the internet, too). </p>
<p>CodeBuddies initially launched near the end of August 2014 as a set of Google Group mailing lists; the hangouts were proposed via individual google calendars. This setup was not ideal, since there was no way to see a list of all the upcoming hangouts, and one had to be invited to the Google Calendar in order to propose a new study session. The Google Group mailing lists did beget a lot of awesome knowledge sharing discussions, but there was no convenient way to search for them.</p>

<p>This platform (<a href="//hangouts.codebuddies.org">hangouts.codebuddies.org</a>) launched on January 1st, 2015 after at least 50 hangouts, one in-person meetup in NYC in October, some late Christmas-New Year's Eve week nights, and feedback from some smart people.</p> 

<p>The platform has gone through a couple of design iterations since January. The <a href="//codebuddiesmeet.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Slack chatroom</a> was created in April after realizations that having a better chatroom could help people connect more spontaneously.</p> 

<p>Special thanks to these folks for their support and inspiration: The Orbital community, Arthur, Gary, Muhammed, Lezou, Ethan, Tina, Brenda, Elaine, Nancy, Alice, Scott, John, Parth, Russ, Aidan, Edlyn, Nikki, Chris, Kenny, Myles, Benjamin, Darrell, Giana, Parinda, Lenny, Sacha, Alan, and EVERYONE who's shared knowledge in the community.</p>
